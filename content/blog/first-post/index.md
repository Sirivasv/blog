This is my first blog post and I would like to thank [**Divyanshu Maithani**](https://twitter.com/divyanshu013) for developing this awesome and light blog site that I am using, you should definitely should check his work on [GitHub](https://github.com/divyanshu013) and on his [blog](https://divyanshu013.dev/).

Now I proceed to make some experiments.

```js
// Testing coding template
const var1 = "Hello";
console.log(var1);
```

## Testing Section Management

Another `section`.

## Testing Latex/Math/Katex Syntax
Some math stuff $\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i$.

$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$. 
$$
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
$$
