## About me

I'm a MS student in computer science at UNAM in MÃ©xico, and I am interested in the computational analysis of audio signals. I am also interested in cognitive perception of music and creative systems. I sometimes play and create songs using GarageBand or Ableton you can fin them in my [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdegppamDMrM2L256RxyOMA). I also share some news regarding Music Information Retrieval at my [twitter](https://twitter.com/sirivasv).

You may follow me on  for latest updates.
